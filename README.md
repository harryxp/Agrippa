Agrippa is a keyboard-driven web application that helps the user perform
various tasks.

It is inspired by tools like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and
[Butler](https://manytricks.com/butler/), but is designed to work on multiple
operating systems (at least Linux and Mac OS X for now).

It is named after [Marcus Vipsanius
Agrippa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Vipsanius_Agrippa), right-hand
man of [Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus), _Princeps Civitatis_
of ancient Rome.
